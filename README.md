👋 Hi there, my name is Santiago Bosch

>_ About me:
I'm a Front-End developer with a primary focus on backend development in Go, Java, and JavaScript. I have a basic understanding of AngularJS, JQuerry, TypeScript, POO, and MongoDB.
My passion for programming drives me to stay updated and continuously learn. In addition to my technical skills, I am characterized by my ability for effective communication, strong human relationships,
and skills to manage time. As a self-learner, I always seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and learn from others too. My career is oriented towards full stack development with a special inclination towards the backend.
Outside of work, I enjoy moments of introspection accompanied by a good cup of coffee ☕, mate 🧉, as well as climbing 🧗🏼 and cycling 🚴🏼‍♂️ and of course I love pizza 🍕.
